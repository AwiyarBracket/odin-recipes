        <h3>Lasagne Verdi alla Bolognese</h3>
        <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from 
            the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of 
            changes suggested to me by people from the area, such 
            as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk 
            added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the 
            green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an 
            authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices.
             Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.
