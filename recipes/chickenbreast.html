        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) chicken breasts
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil
            </li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
            </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced
            </li>
            <li>¾ cup water
            </li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine
            </li>
            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) envelope dry chicken gravy mix
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle both sides of the chicken breasts with onion powder, salt, and pepper.

            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.

            </li>
            <li>Add garlic and mushrooms and cook until mushrooms have released their liquid and are reduced in size, about 5 minutes.

            </li>
            <li>Stir together water, white wine, and gravy packet in a small bowl and pour into the skillet.

            </li>

            <li>Bring liquid to a simmer, cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 5 minutes. Turn chicken breasts and continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

            </li>

        </ol>
