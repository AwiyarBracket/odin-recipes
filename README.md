# odin-recipes
My first html project was putting togheter 3 food recipees using relative links from the index to respective recipe pages. In respective recipe pages I worked with basic boilerplate including lists, images and so on..

Aside from the html aspect, I also worked with git in the terminal and the advantage and need of constantly commiting your work to github.
